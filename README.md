# percentage-calculator
1. We have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT to build this project
2. HTML is simple we have created 3 inputs with id's to make them accessible in javascript
3. In javascript we have used "KEYUP" event :- The keyup event occurs when the user releases a key on the keyboard.
4. And a event handler which basically a function which triggers when keyup event occurs
5. When we extract the values from input tag we get it in the form of string to convert it into the number we used method known as parsefloat()
6. After we give input in p and q is still blank in result places we get NaN as the final result because we have divided a number with Not a number we get Not a number
7. So, we check it by using isNaN() method .
